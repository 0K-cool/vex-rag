and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Hash-first deduplication in `index_document()`** — before falling back to a path-based check, the indexer queries LanceDB for rows with a matching `content_hash`. This catches moves and renames: the same content at a new path now updates the `file_path` pointer on the existing chunks instead of re-embedding and leaving orphans at the old path. Re-indexing an unchanged file is still a no-op. Re-embedding only happens when content actually changed.
- **`vacuum_orphans()` indexer method** — inspects every distinct `file_path` in the KB, reports which ones are no longer on disk, and (when `dry_run=False`) deletes the chunks for those paths. Supports a `match` substring filter so deletions can be scoped to a reviewed category rather than sweeping every orphan.
- **`0k-vacuum` CLI command** — user-facing entry point for the orphan sweep. Defaults to dry-run. Flags: `--delete`, `--dry-run`, `--match PATTERN`, `--json`, `--db-path`, `--verbose`. Human-readable report lists every orphan path with a ✓ next to the ones that were actually deleted.
- **6 unit tests** (`tests/test_vacuum_orphans.py`) — clean KB, missing-file detection, delete-without-match, `--match` preserves non-matching orphans, match-nothing noop, empty-table safety.

### Safety Policy
- Orphan detection is a **signal**, not **permission to delete**. A `file_path` that no longer exists on disk may represent content that was moved off-tree, renamed, or deliberately dereferenced from its source while the knowledge is still wanted in retrieval. `0k-vacuum` defaults to dry-run for this reason; prefer `--match PATTERN` for every real deletion so a review-before-delete discipline is built into the tool.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- **RENAMED:** Vex RAG → 0K-RAG across documentation and metadata
- Package name: `vex-rag` → `0k-rag` (pyproject.toml, plugin.json)
- GitHub repository: `0K-cool/vex-rag` → `0K-cool/0k-rag` (old URLs auto-redirect)
- Display name: "Vex RAG Plugin" → "0K-RAG Plugin"
- Historical changelog entries preserved with original naming
- Config filename `.vex-rag.yml` → `.0k-rag.yml`
- MCP server name `vex-knowledge-base` → `0k-rag-knowledge-base`
- URI scheme `vex://` → `0k-rag://`
- MCP server file `vex_kb_server.py` → `ok_rag_server.py`
- Observability scripts renamed: `vex-*` → `0k-rag-*`
- `lance_vex_kb` database path preserved (legacy, existing installations)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **LanceDB concurrent writer corruption** — added exclusive file lock (`fcntl.flock`) to all write operations. LanceDB does not handle concurrent writers; when MCP server and CLI indexer ran simultaneously, it caused fragment corruption and FTS index failures. Lock file at `<db_path>/.write.lock` with 30s timeout.
  - `index_chunks()` — table create/append locked
  - `index_document()` — dedup check-then-delete locked (TOCTOU fix)
  - `delete_by_file()` — file deletion locked
  - `delete_by_project()` — project deletion locked
  - `create_fts_index()` — FTS index creation locked
  - `rebuild_index()` MCP tool — table drop locked
  - Affects both PAI and ATHENA instances (shared codebase)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Search Health Check** in `get_kb_stats()` — exercises actual vector search path and reports `search_healthy: true/false`. Detects corrupted LanceDB fragments that metadata-only checks miss.
- **FTS Index Validation** — verifies FTS/BM25 index files exist on disk before reporting `fts_enabled: true`
- **`rebuild_index` MCP tool** — drops and recreates the knowledge base from source files. Use when search returns 0 results or database is corrupted. Source documents are never affected.

### Fixed
- **BM25/FTS index not created at startup** (v1.3.2) — `create_index()` now called eagerly at pipeline init
- **Corrupted LanceDB detection** — `get_kb_stats()` previously reported healthy status even when vector search was broken due to missing fragment files

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **BM25/FTS index not created at startup** — `RetrievalPipeline.__init__()` never called `bm25_search.create_index()`. The FTS index relied on lazy creation during first search, but if that failed silently (LanceDB version issue, table lock), BM25 was permanently disabled. Hybrid search fell back to vector-only, missing keyword matches for CVE IDs, tool names, and exact command syntax. Fix: eagerly create FTS index at init (idempotent — skips if already exists).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **AI Agent Discoverability** (ATHENA feedback)
  - `search_kb(query, top_k)` MCP tool - always discoverable by AI agents
  - `0k-rag://help` MCP resource - onboarding documentation for agents
  - Enhanced `get_kb_stats()` with `usage_hint` and `example_queries`

- **Progress Notification System**
  - Pluggable notification architecture with `NotifierInterface` protocol
  - `ConsoleNotifier` - terminal progress with progress bars and ANSI colors
  - `WebhookNotifier` - Discord, Slack, Teams webhook templates
  - `CompositeNotifier` - combine multiple notifiers
  - `NullNotifier` - no-op for backward compatibility
  - `MCPProgressCollector` - collects progress for MCP tool responses
  - Pipeline integration (indexer, context generator, embedder)

### Fixed
- **MCP Resource Discoverability** - Templated MCP resources (`0k-rag://search/{query}`) aren't enumerable by AI agents. Added `search_kb` tool as always-discoverable alternative.

### Changed
- `index_document()` now includes progress summary in response
- `get_kb_stats()` returns usage hints and example queries

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **CLI Shebang Portability** - Replaced hardcoded Python interpreter paths with proper package entry points
  - Created `rag/cli/search.py` and `rag/cli/index.py` as standard Python modules
  - CLI commands (`vex-search`, `vex-index`) now install correctly via `pip install -e .`
  - Removed system-specific shebang lines that prevented installation on other machines

- **Ollama Model Verification Warning** - Fixed cosmetic warning during indexing
  - Improved error handling in `embedder.py` and `context_generator.py`
  - Now handles both 'name' and 'model' keys from Ollama API response (API variation support)
  - Clearer error messages when model verification fails

- **Package Configuration** - Removed non-existent `rag.mcp_server` from setuptools packages list
  - MCP server lives in PAI project (`.claude/mcp_servers/`), not in plugin
  - Package now installs without errors

### Changed
- CLI tools now use standard Python entry points instead of standalone scripts
- Improved installation documentation (recommend `pip install -e .` after clone)

### Security
- **Privacy Improvements for Public Repository**
  - Changed author email from personal to public-facing email (`0k.8csjy@8shield.net`)
  - Replaced internal project names with generic equivalents for privacy:
    - `VERSANT-IR` → `IR-Platform`
    - `VERSANT-ATHENA` → `Pentest-Platform`
    - `lance_athena_kb` → `lance_pentest_kb`
  - Renamed `examples/config.athena.yml` → `examples/config.pentest.yml`
  - Updated all example configurations, documentation, and Python docstrings with generic names
  - Ensures repository is suitable for public consumption without exposing internal project details

## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - Plugin Extraction (January 2, 2026)

**Summary:** Initial extraction of Vex RAG system from Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI) monolithic codebase into a standalone, reusable Claude Code Plugin.

**Key Changes:**
- Extracted core RAG modules (indexing, retrieval) into `rag/` package
- Created configurable MCP server that reads from `.vex-rag.yml`
- Built portable CLI tools (vex-search, vex-index)
- Designed slash commands for Claude Code integration
- Implemented auto-indexing via git hook
- Created RAG maintenance subagent for operations

**Migration Path:**
- PAI (monolithic) → v1.0.0 (plugin) requires:
  1. Create `.vex-rag.yml` in project root
  2. Install plugin: `claude plugin install ~/tools/vex-rag`
  3. Copy existing LanceDB: `lance_vex_kb/` (no changes needed)
  4. Update MCP config to use new server location

**Breaking Changes:**
- None (initial release)

**Known Issues:**
- First search always slow (~6s) due to BGE model load (expected behavior)
- Auto-indexing hook requires manual installation per project
- Backup scripts are project-specific (not yet in plugin)

**Upgrade Notes:**
- None (initial release)
